# Serengeti_Hyaena_Feeding_Events

This repository contains the code used for analyzing temporal trends in observed hyena feeding events and their relationship with migratory prey presence, as well as associated figures and appendices.
All figures produced are in the "Results" section.

## Main Analyses

   * glm_nfeeding.Rmd
    Performs the analysis of temporal trends in the number of observed feeding events and their association with the Migratory Prey Presence Index.
    Final model selection is saved in the Excel file Model_selection_nfeeding.xlsx, located in the Results section.

   * Figure2_code.R
    Generates Figure 2, which visualizes the results of the main analysis and trends in clan size.

## Appendices: 

   *Figure_Appendices_S6_S8.R
    Produces the figures presented in Appendices S6 and S8.

### Appendix S4 Analysis:Located in the file Appendix_S4.

   * glm_preytype.Rmd 
     Performs the analysis of prey type (migratory vs. resident)

   * FigureAppendix_S4.R 
     Generates the corresponding figure visualizing the results.
